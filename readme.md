## Three.js Rubkis Cube
An attempt to translate my java model of a rubiks cube into three dimensions. The original goal was to generate a randomized cube and automatically solve it using the most basic cube algorithms, essentially an animation of a cube being solved. Never finished the solve, but I was able to roatate sides to my satisfaction. As it stands, it will only attempt to build the starting cross, and with a particularly lucky start, might even get there!
